# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# 12.times do |n|
#     name = "ass"
#     lop = 'asdsad'
#     sdt = 'sd'
#     aaa = 'fd'
#     Table.create(
#         name: name,
#         lop: lop,
#         sdt: sdt,
#         aaa: aaa,
#     )
